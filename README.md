# Text Summarization Web App 📚🚀🔍

## Overview 🌐
Welcome to the Text Summarization Web App, a project designed to make understanding lengthy textual data easier and more efficient. This web application allows users to extract key information from URLs, PDFs, and images, providing concise summaries that capture the essence of the content.

## How It Works 🛠️
### Supported Formats 🔄
- **URL Summarization:** Enter a URL, and the app fetches the content from the webpage, processes it, and generates a summary.
- **PDF Summarization:** Upload a PDF file, and the app extracts the text, analyzes it, and produces a summary.
- **Image Text Summarization:** Upload an image containing text, and the app uses OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to convert the text into a machine-readable format, summarizing the content.

## Text Summarization Process 📝🔄

After obtaining text data from various sources such as URLs, PDFs, and images, the Text Summarization Web App follows a consistent process to generate concise summaries. The main principles behind the summarization process are outlined below:

### Common Preprocessing Steps
- **Text Extraction:** Extract text from the provided source (URL, PDF, or image).
- **Noise Removal:** Remove unnecessary elements, such as special characters, numbers, and formatting, to clean the text.

### Tokenization and Frequency Analysis
- **Tokenization:** Break the text into individual words or sentences.
- **Stopword Removal:** Eliminate common English stopwords to focus on meaningful content.
- **Word Frequencies:** Analyze the frequency of each word to identify key terms.

### Sentence Scoring
- **Scoring Algorithm:** Assign scores to sentences based on the frequency of important words within each sentence.
- **Length Consideration:** Penalize longer sentences to ensure concise summaries.

### Summary Generation
- **Top Sentences:** Select the top-ranked sentences based on their scores to form the summary.
- **User Preferences:** Allow users to choose from different summarization options, such as brief summary, sentence list, or the entire processed text.

### Summarization Options 📑
Choose from various summarization options, including:
- **Summary:** Get a brief summary of the content.
- **Sentence List:** Retrieve a list of sentences from the text.
- **Text:** Obtain the entire processed text.
- **Formatted Text:** Get the text with formatting.
- **Stopwords:** View common English stopwords.
- **Word Frequencies:** Get the frequencies of words in the text.

## User-Friendly Interface 🖥️
The web app features a responsive and intuitive design, making it easy to navigate. Users can select the type of content they want to summarize, customize summarization preferences, and receive results promptly.

## How to Use 🤔
1. Choose the type of content (URL, PDF, or Image) you want to summarize.
2. Provide the necessary input, such as the URL, PDF file, or image file.
3. Select summarization options, such as the type of summary or information you want.
4. Click the "Submit" button to initiate the summarization process.
