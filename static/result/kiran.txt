Patila, Sudhir B. Landea, Vinay J. Nagalkara, Sonal B. Nikama,*, G.C.Accuracy of features detection and classi ﬁca- tion of machine learning algorithm based on the number of iterations are used in the network.This block provides features information as well as training and testing images of Dragon fruits to the processing block of the algorithm.The accuracy of features is based on image processing operations which increase the quality of dataset images and camera captured images.However, it changes fruit colour of infected part of fruit particularly at the contact point of skin and ﬂesh just after infection.Dataset The dataset contains a different number of Dragon fruit images.Bimantaka, Identi ﬁcation of red dragon fruit using backpropagation method based on android, Int.Arti ﬁcial Neural Network (ANN) Artiﬁcial Neural Network consists of three layers, an input layer, a hidden layer, an output layer.Using the raspberry pi function counts the total numbers of fruits are present in the fruits box.Support Vector Machine (SVM) The working of the Support Vector Machine is based on a supervised learning algorithm.Working path of dragon fruit images for grading and sorting.P.U.Dataset images are collected from different fruit trees from various angles.Workingof these algorithms is based on the, shape, size, weight, color, and diseases of dragon fruits.It continues to produce ﬂowers and set new fruits throughout its fruit bearing seasons.Although, dragon fruit is comparatively free of pests, diseases and disorders special care should be the basics to prevent the orchards from their attacks and occurrence.Dragon fruit is one of the potential options and popularising in resource-poor degraded lands apart from its several nutraceutical advantages.The features or dimensions of the plane surfaces are depending on the features present in the dataset images.Hence, timely detection and necessary precautions needs to follow at farmers ’ends to avoid their spreading and yield and quality losses through development of non- destructive machine learning techniques.H. Jiang, The analysis of plants image recognition based on deep learning and artiﬁcial neural network, IEEE Access 8 (2020) 68828 –68841, https://doi.org/ 10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2986946 .This plant bears fruits for ﬁve months every year, after ﬂowering and pollination it takes the fruits about 50 days to reach maturity.After these, the algorithm compares the camera captured images with the matching features function.Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) The architecture of the Convolutional Neural Network consists of multiple stages in the training process of the algorithm, as shown in Fig.Dragon fruit Plant it is a fast-growing crop.It is dif ﬁcult detect their infection even after 3 –7 days depending upon fruit stages.Patil et al.Introduction Dragon fruit, pitahaya or strawberry pear (Hylocereus spp.These images are classi ﬁed into various groups such as color, size, weight, shape, and diseases.Proposed system architecture for grading and sorting technique of dragon fruits.When the hidden layer increases in ANN network operation it needs to update weights (contain input information) and bias function.Bhat, Plant disease detection using machine learning, in: International Conference on Design Innovations for 3CsCompute Communicate Control (ICDI3C), 2018, pp.The attack of fruit ﬂies viz., Bactroceradorsalis and Bacro- cera correcta was reported in the farmer ’sﬁeld in India and causes yield * Corresponding author.kernels, convolution layer, recti ﬁed linear units (a type of activation function), and max pooling function (subsampling layer).The output network sends feedback or backpropagation path to the input when an error is created in the output.The fuzzy C-means functionseparates the leaf andfruit images usingdisease features and the histogram sends this information toANN without any loss(see Fig.All operational stages are connected to fully connected layers and it provides the ﬁnal output layer of the network.A deeplearning algorithmalso detects the plant leaf using the same features.Johari, An effective approach to an image retrieval using SVM classi ﬁer, Int.UsingFully Connectedlayers of CNN theSVM classi ﬁer detects the features of thefruit and classi ﬁes it.
